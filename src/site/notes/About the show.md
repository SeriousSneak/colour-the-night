Christmas has always been my favourite holiday of the year. I have always marvelled at houses that have Christmas lights synchronised to music. This is especially true for the North Pole display in Linden Woods, where I first drew inspiration from. This is a house that we visit every year when looking at Christmas light displays. I was watching the display on that house in 2022 when I decided it was time I figure out how it was done and put together a show of my own. 

2023 was my first light show. I did a trial run on Halloween night which was very successful, and then fan the show for all of December and into the first week of January. In 2024 I'm adding a mega tree to the display along with some additional props.
